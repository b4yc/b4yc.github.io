My personal website

This repository hosts the working files of my personal website which can be found [here](bayleecheung.com).
My website is proudly powered by Hugo and has been personalized using my knowledge of markdown, HTML, and CSS. To find out more about Hugo and creating a website please click [here](https://gohugo.io/). It's an amazing tool to utilize as an alternative to building a website from scratch (which I am currently in the process of).
