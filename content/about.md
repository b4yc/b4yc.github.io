Hello! My name is Baylee Cheung and I am currently a third year Software Engineering student pursuing a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I am a driven student at the University of Calgary aspiring to make a positive impact in this world through technology. I love using creative approaches to find innovative solutions, and I believe software is the perfect medium for unlimited potential. I am passionate about streamlining the interaction between humans and technology and I am constantly learning new things everyday in order to achieve my goals.

I am looking for an internship opportunity to further pursue my goals and to learn!
