<p>At Relectric, our goal is dedicated to accelerating the advancement of sustainable transport, while making this technology more accessible.
At this team, I am the User Interface sub-team lead and I lead a group into creating a fully functioning user interface to implement into the car. This includes both the dashboard system and the infotainment system. From displaying vital information about the vehicle to playing music to make the ride more enjoyable, we are responsible for that. You can find more information about Relectric <a href="teamrelectric.ca">here</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, we have turned this idea into a reality. At the software team, we started creating user interfaces using Adobe XD and using a Raspberry Pi with Buildroot to implement a Python based GUI. The important data given to us from the Electrical team is communicated through a server/client system.

<h2 id="web-proxy">Web Proxy</h2>
<p>A simple Web Proxy that is capable of altering HTTP web pages. This Proxy is an intermediary that intercepts each and every request that will be forwarded to the web server. The servers direct their responses back to the proxy, which in turn passes them on to the client. The proxy will control the responses from the web server and is capable of altering the information sent back to the web browser. This includes text, hyperlinks, and images.</p>
<h2 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h2>
<p>This website is currently powered by Hugo and hosted on Github Pages. Creating my own personal website is a way for me to learn more about web programming and how networks work, as well as learning more programming languages. Through Hugo, I am now proficient in metadata file configuration languages such as .YAML, .TOML, and learning more about .JSON. Using Hugo has also taught me to configure Markdown files and introduce me to the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently working on creating my own website through self-taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="website-and-graphic-design">Website and Graphic Design</h2>
<p>Working at ADC X-Ray and Ultrasound, I have been taking initiative to teach myself how to fluently use the Adobe Suite including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, and more in order to create beautiful Graphic designs for the company. I have created the website, requisition forms, notepads, and more. This personal initiative project has led me to not only learn about graphic design tools, but also creating social media for businesses. Through managing social media accounts and marketing, I learned about Google and Facebook algorithms to promote the business.</p>
